PyUNO Workspace is a modified version of Pyzo IDE Workspace plugin, designed for Python and PyUNO introspection. The plugin builds upon Pyzo's tried and tested interactive and introspection capabilities by making them UNO aware. This allows the developers to inspect arbitrary UNO objects in the same manner as the regular Python objects, as well as providing easy access to UNO API documentation. The final goal is to make the LibreOffice script development a seamless experience for newcomers.  

## Features

* inspect Python and PyUNO objects
* display methods with arguments description
* set arguments for methods to drill down
* iterate over UNO enumerations
* for examined objects:
  * read API Reference
  * find code examples
  * find code snippets
* generate code snippet
* and more:
  * template for macros or custom scripts

## Requirements

Python 3 and Pyzo

[Pyzo IDE](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo) - Runs on Python3 and needs PySide/PySide2/PyQt4/PyQt5. On a modern OS these should be easy to obtain. One can then install Pyzo with python3 -m pip install pyzo

There is [binaries](http://www.pyzo.org/start.html) for Windows, Linux and OS X and installation instructions [here](http://www.pyzo.org/install.html#install) 

## Installation and usage
