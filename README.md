PyUNO Workspace is a modified version of Pyzo's Workspace plugin, designed for Python and PyUNO introspection. The plugin builds upon Pyzo's tried and tested interactive and introspection capabilities by making them UNO-aware. This allows the developers to inspect arbitrary UNO objects in the same manner as the regular Python objects, as well as providing easy access to UNO API documentation. The final goal is to make the LibreOffice script development a seamless experience for newcomers.  

## Features

* inspect Python and PyUNO objects
* display methods with arguments description
* set arguments for methods to drill down
* iterate over UNO enumerations
* for examined objects
  * find code examples
  * find code snippets
* generate code snippet
* and more:
  * template for macros or custom scripts
  * search LibreOffice UNO API documentation ([UNO2Dash](https://github.com/kelsa-pi/UNO2Dash) required)
