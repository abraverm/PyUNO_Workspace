PyUNO Workspace is a modified version of Pyzo IDE Workspace plugin, designed for Python and PyUNO introspection. The plugin builds upon Pyzo's tried and tested interactive and introspection capabilities by making them UNO aware. This allows the developers to inspect arbitrary UNO objects in the same manner as the regular Python objects, as well as providing easy access to UNO API and Python documentation. The final goal is to make the LibreOffice script development a seamless experience for newcomers.  

## Features

* inspect Python and PyUNO objects
* display methods with arguments description
* set arguments for methods to drill down
* iterate over UNO enumerations
* for examined objects:
  * display UNO API documentation or
  * display Python documentation
  * find PyUNO code examples
  * find PyUNO code snippets
* generate code snippet
* and more:
  * template for macros or custom scripts

## Requirements

To get started working with PyUNO Workspace and Pyzo, youâ€™ll need:
* Python 3 interpreter for your operating system
* PySide or PySide2 or PyQt4 or PyQt5
* Pyzo IDE
* PyUNO Workspace and
* LibreOffice 5+

[Pyzo IDE](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo) - Runs on Python3 and needs PySide/PySide2/PyQt4/PyQt5. One can install Pyzo with `python3 -m pip install pyzo`. There is [binaries](http://www.pyzo.org/start.html) for Windows, Linux and OS X and installation instructions [here](http://www.pyzo.org/install.html#install)
